# 🏎️ Formula 1 Race Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts the **finishing order of all 20 drivers** in a Formula 1 race based on historical data, driver stats, and current grid positions. Built using FastF1, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, and Streamlit.

---

## 📦 Features
- Predict full race finishing positions
- Supports all 2024 races (auto-loaded from FastF1)
- Inputs: Grid position per driver
- Feature engineered with:
  - Average grid & race positions
  - Driver & team experience
  - Total Points from 2024
  - Qualifying score
- Deployable via Streamlit Cloud

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Model**
- Trained with: `StackingRegressor`
- Base estimators: Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost, GradientBoosting
- Final estimator: Ridge or Lasso
- Feature scaling: `StandardScaler`
- Saved as: `stack_model.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`, `feature_columns.pkl`

### 2. **Data**
- Source: [FastF1](https://docs.fastf1.dev/)
- Final dataset: `f1_final_data.csv`, merged with driver/team stats
- Manually created files:
  - `filtered_drivers_info.csv`

### 3. **Streamlit App**
- UI includes:
  - Dropdown to select race
  - Input grid positions for all 20 drivers
  - Display predicted order
